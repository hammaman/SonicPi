 AIMS OF THE PROJECT

 The aim of the project is to create a "program" in Sonic Pi which will 
 generate songs randomly.
 
 There are different versions as I explore and discover what works and what doesn't!
 
 Version 1: Basic code, with no variation between bars (for discussion at Raspberry Jams)
 Version 2: Developed with some variation between bars
